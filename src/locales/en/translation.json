    "text": "National elections will be held in Austria on 29 September. According to the polls, an FPÖ-ÖVP government is the most likely outcome. For the first time in Austrian history, the FPÖ could become chancellor. We say: A far-right government is unacceptable. The FPÖ-ÖVP government cannot bring the change that is needed. Instead, the crises we are currently experiencing will be exacerbated. The real solutions to these crises lie in a left-wing response. Many people living in Austria are not allowed to vote, which is why we want to show that there is a strong civil society that stands for a future based on solidarity. That is why we are taking to the streets together on 26 September! Life has become more difficult for many people in recent years: Rents, energy and food costs are rising. At the same time, racist, patriarchal and queer-hostile violence is also on the rise. An FPÖ-ÖVP government provides no answers to any of these crises, on the contrary: exploitation, injustice and violence will increase. Racist, patriarchal and profit-orientated structures will become even more entrenched, and social and climate justice will recede into the distance. Asylum law will become even less humane. This will mean harsh realities, especially for people with fewer privileges.<br/><br/>In a large demonstration made up of many organisations, initiatives and individuals, we are showing that there are diverse and viable answers to the crises. We are taking to the streets together against the right to demand a future of solidarity in which a good life is possible for everyone.<br/><br/>We invite everyone to take to the streets with us on (historic) Thursday 26 September and be loud. Together we will show how many people in Austria will not accept a far-right government."
